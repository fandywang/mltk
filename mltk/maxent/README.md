MLTK.MaxEnt
==========================
Maximum Entropy Modelling.

### Features
1. object-oriented design (OOD).
2. supporting real-valued features.
3. supporting three effective parameter estimation methods, including SGD,
   LBFGF and OWLQN
4. supporting a simple feature selection (feature cutoff)

Usage
---------------------
### 1. Data format
The corpus for training/test the model have the line format as follows:

    [instance1]
    [instance2]
    ...
    [instanceM]

in which each line is one instance. [instancei] is the ith instane of the dataset that consists of a list of Ni features.

    [instancei] = class\t[feature1:value1]\t[feature2:value2]\t...\t[featureNi:valueNi]

in which all [featurej:valuej] &lt; j=1...Ni&gt; are feature-value pairs and they are separated by the tab character.

### 2. Training
#### Command line

        Usage: ./bin/maxent_trainer [options].
        --helpshort  show this help message and exit
