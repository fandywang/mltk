## python-sparselda
================
python-sparselda is a Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) topic modeling package based on SparseLDA Gibbs Sampling inference algorithm, and written in Python 2.6 or newer, Python 3.0 or newer excluded.

Frankly, python-sparselda is just a mini-project, we hope it can help you better understand the standard LDA and SparseLDA algorithms. RTFSC for more details. Have fun.

Please use the github issue tracker for python-sparselda at:
https://github.com/fandywang/mltk/tree/master/mltk/lda/python.

## Usage
================
### 1. Install Google Protocol Buffers
python-sparselda serialize and persistent store the lda model and checkpoint based on protobuf, so you should install it first.

    wget https://protobuf.googlecode.com/files/protobuf-2.5.0.tar.bz2
    tar -zxvf protobuf-2.5.0.tar.bz2
    cd protobuf-2.5.0
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    cd python
    python ./setup.py build
    sudo python ./setup.py install

    cd python-sparselda/common
    protoc -I=. --python_out=. lda.proto

### 2. Training
#### 2.1 Command line
    Usage: python lda_trainer.py [options].

    Options:
    -h, --help   show this help message and exit
    --corpus_dir=CORPUS_DIR
            the corpus directory.
    --vocabulary_file=VOCABULARY_FILE
            the vocabulary file.
    --num_topics=NUM_TOPICS
            the num of topics.
    --topic_prior=TOPIC_PRIOR
            the topic prior alpha (50 / num_topics).
    --word_prior=WORD_PRIOR
            the word prior beta (0.01).
    --total_iterations=TOTAL_ITERATIONS
            the total iteration.
    --model_dir=MODEL_DIR
            the model directory.
    --save_model_interval=SAVE_MODEL_INTERVAL
            the interval iterations to save lda model.
    --topic_word_accumulated_prob_threshold=TOPIC_WORD_ACCUMULATED_PROB_THRESHOLD
            the accumulated_prob_threshold of topic top words.
    --save_checkpoint_interval=SAVE_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL
            the interval to save checkpoint.
    --checkpoint_dir=CHECKPOINT_DIR
            the checkpoint directory.
    --compute_loglikelihood_interval=COMPUTE_LOGLIKELIHOOD_INTERVAL
            the interval to compute loglikelihood.

#### 2.2 Input corpus format
The corpus for training/estimating the model have the line format as follows:

    [document1]
    [document2]
    ...
    [documentM]

in which each line is one document. [documenti] is the ith document of the dataset that consists of a list of Ni words/terms.

    [documenti] = [wordi1]\t[wordi2]\t...\t[wordiNi]

in which all [wordij] &lt;i=1...M, j=1...Ni&gt; are text strings and they are separated by the tab character.

**Note that** the terms document and word here are abstract and should not only be understood as normal text documents.
This's because LDA can be used to discover the underlying topic structures of any kind of discrete data. Therefore,
python-sparselda is not limited to text and natural language processing but can also be applied to other kinds of data
like images.

Also, keep in mind that for text/Web data collections, you should first preprocess the data (e.g., word segment,
removing stopwords and rare words, stemming, etc.) before estimating with python-sparselda.

#### 2.3 Input vocabulary format
The vocabulary for training/estimating the model have the line format as follows:

    [word1]
    [word2]
    ...
    [wordV]

in which each line is a unique word. Words only appear in vocabulary will be considered for parameter estimation.

#### 2.4 Outputs
##### 1) LDA Model
It includs three files.
* lda.topic_word_hist: This file contains the word-topic histograms, i.e., N(word|topic).
* lda.global_topic_hist: This file contains the global topic histogram, i.e., N(topic).
* lda.hyper_params: This file contails the hyperparams, i.e., alpha and beta.

##### 2) Checkpoint
Every `--save_checkpoint_interval` iterations, the lda_trainer will dump current checkpoint for fault tolerance.
The checkpoint mainly includes two types files.
* LDA Model: See above.
* Corpus: This directory contains serialized documents.

##### 3) Topic words
* lda.topic_words: This file contains most likely words of each topic. The number of topic top words is depend on `--topic_word_accumulated_prob_threshold`.

### 3. Inference
Please refer the example: lda_inferencer.py.

**Note that** we strongly recommend you to use `MultiChainGibbsSampler` class for trade off between efficiency and effectiveness.

### 4. Evaluation
Instead of manual evaluation, we want to evaluate topics quality automatically, and filter out a few meaningless topics to enchance the inference effect.

## TODO
================
1. Hyperparameters optimization.
2. Memory optimization.
3. Data and model parallelization.
